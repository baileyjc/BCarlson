PhD student in the Dawson Lab at the University of California, Merced

I study communities and organisms within marine island systems to better inform island biogeography. I focus on fish in my current PhD work but I enjoy working with invertebrates as I have done in the past with sea urchins and with projects I have been involved with for my PhD.

I make my repositories available to the public with the hope of my science being repeatable and reproducible. I am by no means a computational expert so as I tell my kids, if you see something, say something, please.
